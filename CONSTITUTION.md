# Project Constitution

1. **AI-Driven Development**: All code must be generated by the AI (Gemini). No manual coding is allowed.
2. **Spec-Driven**: Every feature must be defined in a markdown specification file before implementation.
3. **Clean Code**: Follow PEP 8 standards for Python. Use meaningful variable names and clear comments.
4. **Environment**: Use Python 3.13+ and manage dependencies using `uv`.
5. **Iteration**: If the code fails or has bugs, update the Spec file instead of fixing the code manually.
